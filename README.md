If you want to learn Node.js or round out your knowledge, it's an affordable
option covering core functionality, the NPM ecosystem, Express, MongoDB and
Mongoose. He also covers more advanced topics including debugging, TDD,
async (promises), REST and JWT... but to keep the course approachable, these
sections are of limited depth. Certainly enough to be educational though!
